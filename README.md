# configurational_files
Some files needed to configure some software properly.

.vimrc

```
File used by vim text editor. This config file basically 
contains some configurational variables which will make 
vim usage more comfortable.
```

.xinitrc

```
File, used by X11 (if I recall that correctly) and inside 
there is also some config scripts and variables which will 
make the experience much better and lighter.
