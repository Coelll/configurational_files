You can use a software called "reflector" in order to rank mirrors. There is a bunch of keys available for this specific piece of software, I'll try to cover some most useful of them here.

Install refelctor.

$ sudo pacman -S reflector rsync curl

Backup the current mirrorlist.
---
$ sudo cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.bak

Get 15 mirrors, with https protocol, sort them by download rate and save.
---
$ sudo reflector --latest 15 --protocol https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

---
$ sudo reflector --verbose --country 'HERE'S A COUNTRY NAME' -l 15 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
